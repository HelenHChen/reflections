What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Meta-data .git is created, this is needed to keep history info on your repository (such as commit history).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the "middle" between your working directory (on your hard drive) and your repository. It allows you to pick and choose which file(s) you want to commit at a time by committing only files in the staging area. This offers flexibility on what you want to commit.
